# How to play:-

    Just press the location where you wanna drop your selection as the First player. then repeat this step as the Second player.
    Red color represents 1st player as Yello color represents 2nd player.
    Make sure that any of the players won't get four in a row. (whether it's from horizontal, diagonals, or vertical) by blocking their way to the win. and try to win by yourself.
    And the player who did it well.
